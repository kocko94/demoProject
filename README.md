# The GitHub demo project

Here is the requested demo project. 

I've decided to use fragments for this project. Therefore, you will find the following techniques:

1. Glide, off course, for loading images
2. The main fragment (called *ReposListFragment*) is build using MVP. Given the simplicity of the project, it is there simply for demonstration purposes
3. Shared view transitions, SwipeRefreshLayout, Retrofit2, CoordinatorLayout with animations and many more
4. The app is **entirely** written in Kotlin because as a language is **much more superior** than Java! 


Please excuse my approach for presenting the details of a clicked repo inside of my *DetailsFragment* (simply inside of a *TextView*) but I am quite limited in my free time in the last couple of days. Thus, I was not able to make something more beautiful but I hope that you will see clearly that this is not because of a lack of knowledge given the rest of the code :).
